iTunes Library Simulator
========

Created an iTunes library simulator for an object oriented programming class. The program organizes a simulated iTunes library and lets you search through it. Has classes for Media, a song, a class that reads in an iTunes libaray (iTunesReader) and a Music Searcher class which searches through the library. Search will show you the location of the file in the file system, the artist, song name and genre for each song it finds.
